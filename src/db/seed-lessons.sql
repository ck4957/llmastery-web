   '# Prompting Techniques

## The Art and Science of Prompting

Prompting is the process of crafting input text to guide an LLM''s responses. Effective prompting is crucial for getting the most out of these powerful models.

## Basic Prompting Principles

### 1. Be Clear and Specific
The more specific your prompt, the more targeted the response will be.

**Example:**
- Vague: "Tell me about dogs."
- Specific: "Explain the key differences between Labradors and Golden Retrievers in terms of temperament, care needs, and common health issues."

### 2. Provide Context
Including relevant context helps the model understand what you''re looking for.

**Example:**
- Without context: "How do I fix this error?"
- With context: "I''m building a React application and getting this error: ''Cannot read property ''map'' of undefined''. How can I fix it?"

### 3. Structure Your Prompt
Breaking down complex requests into structured sections can improve results.

**Example:**
```
I need a business email to a client about project delays:
- Tone: Professional but apologetic
- Context: Software development project delayed by 2 weeks
- Key points: Technical challenges encountered, new timeline, compensatory measures
```

## Advanced Prompting Techniques

### 1. Chain of Thought Prompting
Ask the LLM to work through a problem step-by-step.

**Example:**
"Let''s solve this word problem step-by-step: If Lisa has 5 apples and buys 3 more, but gives 2 to her friend, how many apples does she have now?"

### 2. Role-Based Prompting
Assign a specific role or persona to the LLM.

**Example:**
"As an experienced cybersecurity expert, explain the implications of zero-day vulnerabilities to a non-technical board of directors."

### 3. Few-Shot Learning
Provide examples of the desired output format.

**Example:**
```
Convert these sentences to past tense:
1. I walk to the store. â†’ I walked to the store.
2. She sings beautifully. â†’ She sang beautifully.
3. They run every morning. â†’ 
```

### 4. Refinement Iterations
Use multiple interactions to refine outputs.

1. Initial prompt: "Write a short story about time travel."
2. Refinement: "Make the story more suspenseful and set it in Victorian London."
3. Further refinement: "Add a twist ending that connects to the beginning."

## Common Pitfalls

- **Ambiguity**: Avoid vague language that could be interpreted in multiple ways
- **Overly Complex Requests**: Break down complex tasks into smaller, manageable prompts
- **Contradictory Instructions**: Ensure your prompt doesn''t contain conflicting guidance

## Practical Applications

- **Content Creation**: Generate outlines, drafts, or creative ideas
- **Problem-Solving**: Work through complex problems with guided reasoning
- **Learning**: Request explanations at varying levels of complexity
- **Code Generation**: Create code snippets with specific functionalities

In the next lesson, we''ll explore how to evaluate and improve LLM outputs for different use cases.

   'Fine-tuning LLMs', 
   'Understand how to adapt pre-trained models to specific domains and tasks.',
   '# Fine-tuning LLMs

## What is Fine-tuning?

Fine-tuning is the process of further training a pre-trained language model on a specific dataset to adapt it for particular tasks or domains. This process allows you to create more specialized models that excel at specific functions while leveraging the general knowledge and capabilities of the base model.

## When to Consider Fine-tuning

Fine-tuning is particularly valuable when:

- You need consistent output formats or styles
- Your application requires domain-specific knowledge
- You want to align the model with particular values or guidelines
- You need to improve performance on specialized tasks
- You require reduced latency for specific applications

## The Fine-tuning Process

### 1. Preparing Your Dataset

The quality of your fine-tuning dataset largely determines the quality of your fine-tuned model.

**Key considerations:**
- **Size**: Typically hundreds to thousands of examples
- **Quality**: High-quality, consistent examples
- **Diversity**: Representative of real-world use cases
- **Format**: Usually input-output pairs in a structured format

**Example dataset format:**
```json
[
  {
    "input": "Summarize the following medical research abstract: [abstract text]",
    "output": "This research investigated..."
  },
  {
    "input": "Summarize the following medical research abstract: [abstract text]",
    "output": "The study examined..."
  }
]
```

### 2. Selecting a Base Model

Choose an appropriate pre-trained model based on:

- Size and computational requirements
- Base capabilities
- Licensing terms
- Availability and support

### 3. Hyperparameter Selection

Fine-tuning requires setting several important hyperparameters:

- **Learning rate**: Typically much smaller than in pre-training
- **Number of epochs**: How many times to iterate through the dataset
- **Batch size**: Number of examples processed together
- **Optimizer settings**: Adam is commonly used

### 4. Training Infrastructure

Fine-tuning can be resource-intensive:

- GPU/TPU requirements vary by model size
- Cloud services offer specialized fine-tuning environments
- Smaller models may be fine-tuned on consumer hardware

### 5. Evaluation

Assess your fine-tuned model against:

- Hold-out test set performance
- Business metrics relevant to your application
- Baseline performance of the pre-trained model

## Fine-tuning Techniques

### Full Fine-tuning

Update all or most parameters in the model:
- Provides maximum adaptation
- Requires more data and computational resources
- Higher risk of catastrophic forgetting

### Parameter-Efficient Fine-tuning (PEFT)

Update only a small subset of parameters:
- **LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation)**: Adds low-rank matrices to existing weights
- **Adapters**: Inserts small trainable modules between layers
- **Prompt Tuning**: Trains continuous prompt vectors

Benefits include:
- Much smaller storage requirements
- Reduced computational needs
- Easier to combine multiple adaptations

## Practical Considerations

### Ethical and Safety Guardrails

Fine-tuning can potentially remove safety guardrails from base models:
- Consider implementing additional safety filters
- Test extensively for harmful outputs
- Maintain oversight of the fine-tuning data

### Avoiding Overfitting

Signs of overfitting include:
- Perfect performance on training data but poor generalization
- Memorization of specific examples rather than learning patterns
- Degraded performance on general knowledge tasks

### Managing Expectations

Fine-tuned models:
- Won''t gain knowledge that wasn''t in the training data
- May still make mistakes in domain-specific outputs
- Require ongoing evaluation and potentially retraining

## Case Studies

### Domain-Specific Assistants

Fine-tuning for specialized fields like:
- Legal document analysis
- Medical diagnosis assistance
- Technical customer support

### Style and Format Adaptation

Fine-tuning to consistently produce:
- Brand-specific marketing copy
- Structured data extraction
- Code in specific styles or patterns

In the next lesson, we''ll explore how to deploy and integrate fine-tuned models into production systems.
